defmodule Bodyguard.Schema do
  @moduledoc """
  Specify user-accessible items.

  The callbacks are designed to live within your schemas, hidden from the
  context boundaries of your application.

  All you have to do is implement the `c:scope/3` callback on your schema.
  What "access" means is up to you, and can be customized on a case-by-case
  basis via `params`.

  Typically the callbacks are designed to be used by `Bodyguard.scope/3` and
  are not called directly.

  If you want to use separate module for scoping, you can `use` it with the
  `scope_with` option, which will define the `c:scope/3` callback wrapper for
  you:

      defmodule MyApp.MyModel.MySchema do
        use Bodyguard.Schema, scope_with: Some.Other.Scope
      end
  """

  @doc """
  Specify user-accessible items.

  This callback is expected to take a `query` of this schema and filter it
  down to results that are only accessible to `user`. Arbitrary `params` may
  also be specified.

      defmodule MyApp.MyModel.MySchema do
        @behaviour Bodyguard.Schema
        import Ecto.Query, only: [from: 2]

        def scope(query, user, _params) do
          from ms in query, where: ms.user_id == ^user.id
